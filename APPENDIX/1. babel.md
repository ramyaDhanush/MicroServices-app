# babel

Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

- Transform syntax
- Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through a third-party polyfill such as core-js)
- Source code transformations (codemods)

## Installation

`npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env`

## Configuration

Create a file `babel.config.json`  in root of the directory

1. Add presets (A preset is a set of plugins used to support particular language features)
```json
  {
    "presets": [
      [
        "@babel/env",
        {
          "targets": {
            "edge": "17",
            "firefox": "60",
            "chrome": "67",
            "safari": "11.1"
          },
          "useBuiltIns": "usage",
          "corejs": "3.6.5"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
```
