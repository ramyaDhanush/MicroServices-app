# Docker

- Docker is an application that simplifies the process of managing application processes in containers. 
- Containers let you run your applications in resource-isolated processes.
- Theyâ€™re similar to virtual machines, but containers are more portable, more resource-friendly, 
and more dependent on the host operating system.
